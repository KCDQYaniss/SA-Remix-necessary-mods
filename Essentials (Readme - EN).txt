There are more important mods and good practices on how to modify GTA.

https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/Essentials.html
It's very important to always have the latest versions of these mods to fix problems, have new features, be able to install new mods etc.


Originally Silent's ASI Loader comes with a "scripts" folder but few people install .asi in it, they prefer to install it in ModLoader.
If you want, just create a folder called "scripts" in the game folder and install the ASI mods in it.
