------- Instructions:

GameUX.dll communicates for updates, which causes problems when trying to run an old game.

Attention: This will completely remove GameUX.dll and change compatibility registry.
           Looks like GameUX.dll isn't used on Windows 10, only on Windows 7 bellow, but it still exists.
           You still have the option of running .bat on Windows 10 to remove it anyway, it's safe.

Extract everything to a folder on your PC.

Run the file "gameux_delet.bat" IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE.
Check that there was no "access" denied message or anything.

Once everything is right, you can also run "GameUX_DisableShims.reg", just confirm.

Then, maybe you DON'T need "rundll32exefix.asi" anymore.
